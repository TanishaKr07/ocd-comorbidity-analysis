## 📌 Project Overview  

Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a complex mental health condition that can co-occur with other mental health disorders such as Anxiety and Depression. Understanding whether demographic factors (age, sex, ethnicity, education, marital status) influence OCD comorbidity patterns may provide insights into patient vulnerability and treatment planning.  

This project uses a synthetic dataset of 1,500 simulated OCD patients to explore potential patterns and relationships between demographic factors and OCD comorbidities. It focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and baseline predictive modeling.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives  

- Explore the distribution of OCD comorbidities (Anxiety Only, Depression Only, Both, None) in the dataset.  
- Analyze how demographic variables interact with comorbidity patterns.  
- Evaluate whether demographic factors can predict comorbidity status using baseline predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest).  
- Explore clustering using K-Means to identify any natural groupings among patients.

## 📊 Dataset  

- **Source:** Kaggle (synthetic dataset) [Link to dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ohinhaque/ocd-patient-dataset-demographics-and-clinical-data)
- **Size:** 1500 rows × 17 columns  

**Relevant Features:**  
- **Age:** Patient age (18–75)  
- **Sex:** Biological sex at birth (Male/Female)  
- **Ethnicity:** (African, Asian, Caucasian, Hispanic)  
- **Marital Status:** (Single, Divorced, Married)  
- **Education Level:** (High School, Some College, College Degree, Graduate Degree)  
- **Depression Only:** Binary indicator for depression diagnosis alongside OCD  
- **Anxiety Only:** Binary indicator for anxiety diagnosis alongside OCD  

⚠️ *Note: The dataset is synthetic and intended solely for analysis and demonstration purposes. Observed patterns do not represent real patients.*

## 🔎 Analysis Approach  

### 1. Data Preprocessing  
- Missing value checks (none found)  
- Binary encoding of depression and anxiety diagnoses  
- Creation of multi-class labels: Depression Only, Anxiety Only, Both, None  
- One-hot encoding for categorical features  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Overall distribution of comorbidities  
- Age-wise and demographic comparisons  
- Heatmaps, mosaic plots, and Sankey diagrams to visualize interactions  

### 3. Predictive Modeling  
- Logistic Regression (multinomial)  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Evaluation of predictive performance (classification reports & confusion matrices)  

### 4. Clustering  
- K-Means clustering to explore natural groupings among patients

## 📈 Key Findings  

- No strong association observed between demographic variables and OCD comorbidity.  
- Age, sex, ethnicity, education, and marital status do not significantly differentiate comorbidity categories.  
- Predictive models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) performed poorly, with accuracies around or below random guessing levels for a four-class problem.  
- K-Means clustering did not reveal meaningful clusters that correspond to comorbidity patterns.  

➡️ Overall, demographic factors in this synthetic dataset are minimally informative for predicting OCD comorbidity.

## 📊 Visualizations  

The project includes:  
- Pie charts and bar plots showing comorbidity distributions  
- Boxplots for age comparisons across demographics  
- Heatmaps for gender × ethnicity interactions  
- Mosaic plots for education × marital status interactions  
- Sankey diagrams showing demographic flows to comorbidity outcomes  

📷 Screenshots of key visualizations are included in the notebook for reference.

## ✅ Conclusion  

This project demonstrates a structured approach to EDA, baseline predictive modeling, and clustering, even when no strong patterns are present. It highlights the importance of careful data exploration before attempting prediction or inference, and provides a framework for similar health informatics analyses.
